23/11/2025 02:17:06 ------------------ USEFUL INFORMATION ------------------
23/11/2025 02:17:06 X DAMAGE available on display, using it for polling hints.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   To disable this behavior use: '-noxdamage'
23/11/2025 02:17:06 
23/11/2025 02:17:06   Most compositing window managers like 'compiz' or 'beryl'
23/11/2025 02:17:06   cause X DAMAGE to fail, and so you may not see any screen
23/11/2025 02:17:06   updates via VNC.  Either disable 'compiz' (recommended) or
23/11/2025 02:17:06   supply the x11vnc '-noxdamage' command line option.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 
23/11/2025 02:17:06 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
23/11/2025 02:17:06   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
23/11/2025 02:17:06    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
23/11/2025 02:17:06    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
23/11/2025 02:17:06      moved window is released in the new position.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
23/11/2025 02:17:06   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
23/11/2025 02:17:06   periodic repaints.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 
23/11/2025 02:17:06 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
23/11/2025 02:17:06   to: '-cursor most'.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
23/11/2025 02:17:06   or '-noxfixes'.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 using XFIXES for cursor drawing.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 GrabServer control via XTEST.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 
23/11/2025 02:17:06 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
23/11/2025 02:17:06   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
23/11/2025 02:17:06   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
23/11/2025 02:17:06   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
23/11/2025 02:17:06   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
23/11/2025 02:17:06   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
23/11/2025 02:17:06   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
23/11/2025 02:17:06   periodic repaints.
23/11/2025 02:17:06 
23/11/2025 02:17:06 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 7 is greater
23/11/2025 02:17:06   than 4 and 51 keysyms are mapped above 4.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
23/11/2025 02:17:06   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
23/11/2025 02:17:06   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
